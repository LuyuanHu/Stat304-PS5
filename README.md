## Reprodeuce of the Paper: A General Age-Specific Mortality Model with An Example Indexed by Child or Both Child and Adult Mortality
  Most African countries and nearly one third of all countries need to use mortality models to infer a complete age table of mortality rates for population estimates, projections/projections and other demographic and epidemiological tasks. Models that link child mortality to mortality at other ages are important because almost all countries have measures of child mortality. In this article, our goal is to absorb the essence of "A General Age-Specific Mortality Model with An Example Indexed by Child or  Both Child and Adult Mortality" by replicating it. The article of @clark2016general defines a generic parameterized mortality component model (SVD-COMP) using singular value decomposition and calibrates the relationship between child or child/adult mortality and mortality rates at other ages in the mortality table observed in the human mortality database. It also verifies the model by cross-validation and compares the predictive performance of the model with that of the log-quaternion model, which indicates the efficiency of the proposed method.
